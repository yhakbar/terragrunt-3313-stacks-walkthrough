# 02 - Stacks

In the spirit of incremental adjustments, as detailed in the previous walkthrough, this walkthrough will introduce Stacks with a minimal set of changes to demonstrate how Stacks can be adopted to address code reusability in real infrastructure.

## Architecture

        └── terragrunt.hcl
```

The only significant change that has taken place is the introduction of `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files in the `live` directories. These replace the tree of directories that were previously used to define the `api` and `db` Units.

So far, this adjustment has cut down the total number of files in the project by 4, and has made the project more manageable, as updates to the `terragrunt.hcl` files used to define `api` and `db` Units are now defined in a single file. They are referenced by the `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files in the `dev` and `prod` environments within `live`.

This chapter was authored by:
1. Copying + pasting the previous one.
2. Replacing the contents of `live/dev` and `live/prod` with `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files (while maintaining the `environment.hcl` files).
3. Linking to the `mock-stack-generate.sh` script in the root of the project.

### Quick Detour on `.terraform.lock.hcl` Files

You may notice that the `units` directory contains directories that contain both `terragrunt.hcl` files and `.terraform.lock.hcl` files. These `.terraform.lock.hcl` files are generated by OpenTofu/Terraform when it initializes a module, and are used to lock the versions of the providers that are used by it. It can be useful to consistently use the same versions of providers, especially when working in a team, to avoid issues that can arise from different versions of providers behaving differently.

You generally want to commit these files to your repository, as that ensures that updates go through git, but one of the incidental advantages to the design of Stacks is that you only need to track the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file once for the definition of a Unit instead of once per instance of a Unit.

## Walkthrough

To try out the version of this walkthrough that utilizes mock Stacks prototype, run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd live
$ ./mock-stack-generate.sh
$ terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-non-interactive
```

You'll notice that the resources are still provisioned, just as before, but that the Units are now nested in `.terragrunt-stack` directories:

```bash
$ terragrunt run-all apply --terragrunt-non-interactive
14:58:27.656 INFO   The stack at /Users/yousif/repos/src/github.com/yhakbar/terragrunt-3313-stacks-walkthrough/walkthrough/05-aws/02-stacks/live will be processed in the following order for command apply:
Group 1
- Module dev/.terragrunt-stack/storage/db
- Module prod/.terragrunt-stack/storage/db

Group 2
- Module dev/.terragrunt-stack/services/api
- Module prod/.terragrunt-stack/services/api
...
```

## Cleanup

As before, you can clean up the resources by running:

```bash
terragrunt run-all destroy --terragrunt-non-interactive
```

## Next Steps

These `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files can actually allow for even less code duplication, which will be demonstrated in the following chapters.

This simply demonstrates introducing one layer of abstraction over repeated use of `terragrunt.hcl` files, which many users are currently maintaining, to consolidated `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files. We've taken multiple Units in both the `dev` and `prod` environments and consolidated them into a single Stack per environment.

Some users may prefer to stop here, while others may want to introduce more abstraction in their `terragrunt.stack.hcl` files. Ultimately, Terragrunt aims to empower users to make architectural decisions that best fit the needs of their infrastructure, and the design of Stacks is intended to be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of approaches.

By the end of the [05-aws](../) walkthrough, you will have seen how Stacks can also be defined once and re-used in multiple locations, which can be useful for defining common infrastructure patterns that are used across multiple environments.

The [next chapter](../03-no-shared/) will demonstrate how a little more refactoring can further reduce the amount of code that has to be maintained.
