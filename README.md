# Terragrunt Stacks Walkthrough

This repository goes through the process of building up to the concept of a Terragrunt Stack, requiring minimal incremental increases in complexity.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you'll want to install the following tools:

- [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/)
- [OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/)

If you've installed [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise), you can do that by running:

```bash
mise install
```

## Walkthrough

Each of the folders in the `walkthrough` folder is a step in the process of incrementally increasing the complexity of infrastructure under management until a stack is reached.

This should give some insight as to how Stacks work, and how they can be used to manage infrastructure.
