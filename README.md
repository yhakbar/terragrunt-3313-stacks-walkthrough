# Terragrunt Stacks Walkthrough

This repository goes through the process of building up to the concept of a Terragrunt Stack, requiring minimal incremental increases in complexity.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you'll want to install the following tools:

- [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/)
- [OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/)

If you've installed [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise), you can do that by running:

```bash
mise install
```

## Walkthrough

Each of the folders in the `walkthrough` folder is a step in the process of incrementally increasing the complexity of infrastructure under management until a stack is reached.

This should give some insight as to how Stacks work, and how they can be used to manage infrastructure.

You can get some benefit from simply reading the README.md files in each of the folders, but to get the most out of this walkthrough, you'll want to clone the repository and follow the instructions in each of the folders.
